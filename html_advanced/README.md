# Welcome to the HTML Advanced Project!

In this project, you will explore the structure of HTML to build a foundational web page. This project is all about using HTML tags effectively to create well-organized content, without any styling. Expect the end result to be purely functional – it might not look pretty, but it will be well-structured and informative.

## Project Overview
In this HTML project, you will:
1. Practice building a web page using only HTML elements.
2. Learn how to organize content meaningfully without CSS.
3. Use HTML5 structural tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and more.

The end result will be a functional HTML page that displays information clearly, with proper semantic structure.

## Resources
Before diving into this project, it's beneficial to review the following resources:
- [HTML 5.2 Specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
- [HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [HTML Reference - Free Guide](https://htmlreference.io/)
- [Can I use… HTML5, CSS3 support](https://caniuse.com/)
- [HTML Cheat Sheet - WebsiteSetup](https://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:
1. Recognize and follow HTML guidelines.
2. Create a well-organized HTML5 page skeleton.
3. Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`.
4. Understand the differences between `<div>` and `<span>`.
5. Apply media tags for embedding images, videos, and audio.
6. Structure data with tables and understand list formatting.
7. Implement internal navigation and embedded external content.

## Requirements
- **README.md**: This file should be at the root of your project folder.
- **W3C Compliance**: Your code should be W3C compliant, validated through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- **Company Theme**: Use “Techium” as the company name across all pages.
- **Repository Structure**: Organize files and directories as outlined in each task.

## Project Structure

Each HTML file corresponds to a specific milestone task in the project. The following files will be created:
- **`0-index.html` to `39-index.html`**: Core HTML pages with increasing levels of complexity.
- **`styleguide.html`**: A guide page demonstrating specific HTML tags and elements for reuse.

## Tasks

The project consists of various tasks, each building on the previous ones to create a fully structured HTML document. Here’s an overview of some major milestones:

1. **Setting Up the HTML Structure**: Starting with a basic HTML structure including `<doctype>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
2. **Adding Metadata**: Including charset, viewport, title, and description tags in the `<head>` for better metadata management.
3. **Structuring Page Sections**: Organizing content into `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` sections with additional structural tags.
4. **Using Semantic Tags**: Implementing `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<nav>` elements for clear document structure.
5. **Embedding Media and Content**: Adding images, audio, and video elements to illustrate embedding media without CSS.
6. **Creating a Style Guide**: Demonstrating headers, paragraphs, lists, and tables within `styleguide.html`.
7. **Enhancing Navigation and External Links**: Adding internal navigation links and social media icons.

For a detailed breakdown of each task, refer to the instructions provided in the project outline.
